This videos show what happens when an incoming particle hits a very
simple model of crystal composed of mases and springs. The crystal
is initially at zero temperature (the particles are all at rest) and
after the impact the temperature of the crystal is increased because 
(the particles oscillate). In some cases it can be seen a wave that
propagates through the crystal due to the impact.
