Newton++ is a program I have develop in my free time, during my undergraduate studies, to simulate systems of particles under the regime of Classical Mechanics. It was designed to be very flexible allowing for easily implement any configuration of particles with any type of interaction easily configurable. There are also some Octave scripts to automatically process the data generated by Newton++ and produce some plots and videos.

Currently it has no graphical interfase and has to be compiled each time you want to perform a new simulation. 

I think it can be a great tool to produce didactic matearial for teaching in the first years of undergraduate.
