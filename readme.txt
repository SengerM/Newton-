### Old readme:

Newton++ is a program I have develop in my free time, during my undergraduate studies, to simulate systems of particles under the regime of Classical Mechanics. It was designed to be very flexible allowing for easily implement any configuration of particles with any type of interaction. The aim of the program is to ask the user for the system initial state (i.e. particles positions and speeds) and to define the interactions (i.e. the forces) and then the program runs the simulation. The user does not need to know the equations of motion, just the initial state and the forces in each particle.

There are also some Octave scripts to automatically process the data generated by Newton++ and produce some plots and videos.

Currently it has no graphical interfase and has to be compiled each time you want to perform a new simulation.
